How should we handle the social elements well? Would the built in chat work or does it need something else?
How would we enforce the siren's ability to shut down communication?

How exactly does the shoot ye treasure work? Who can shoot treasure? How many treasures can be shot (per person/cannon)? Does everyone have a chance to discard a treasure and fire a missed cannon or just the person who chose that action? If they fire the treasure and the reroll misses, can they keep trying?
